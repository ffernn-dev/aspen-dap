An ipod-inspired digital audio player with modern features and an attempt to return to physical media by using sd-card cartridges to store music.

- Similar to an ipod, touch wheel + screen
- It has an internal microsd card to act as a normal mp3 player
- It also has a section that opens up so you can put a cartridge in.
	- The cartridges will be a microsd card + a circuit board and pogo pins in a plastic case, with room for album artwork on the front
	- Cartridges store albums, or you buy blank ones and make a mixtape for your friends!
	- Cartridges also have metadata so think album/artist artwork, lyrics, and other exclusive stuff
		- OMG they could also have album-themed UI skins for the device!! wallpaper packs too
		- Commentary/interview tracks
		- Early voice memos or demos
	- I'd like to design a case for the cartridges similar to cassette cases where you can have artwork displayed on the front, back and spine.
- Sync over Wi-Fi
- High quality DAC/Amp combination
- Built-in high-quality microphone for voice memos
- Possible future features:
	- Crappy little camera sensor for "nostalgic" digicam photos & videos
	- Bluetooth headphone support
	- Streaming from a jellyfin/navidrome server (self-host your music collection!)
